# Fang
A custom WordPress theme by Code Diva

This theme has a minimalist design, and is fully responsive.

The theme comes with two custom menus. The social menu includes built-in icons, which will be generated automatically based on the URL in the link. Icons are set up for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Google+, RSS, Email, Bloglovin', LinkedIn, YouTube, Vimeo, and Flickr.

There is an option to add up to four footer widgets. The width of these widgets will change based on the number of widget areas that have been populated with widgets. So, if only two footer widget areas have widgets added, the widget areas will be 50% of the width.
